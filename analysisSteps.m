% Analysis Steps

%% Start
% Call mouseList to select animal subset
% Call twoOptoGetData to create the MasterStruct of all sessions

%% Characterizing Single Site Effects
% twoOptoScatterPlots makes pretty V1 versus SC effects compared to control

%% Characterizing Combine Effects
% dPrimeSummaryPlot plots expected effects of dual site stim vs. single

%% Model Scatters
% probSim plots the expected effects for signal versus prob. summation
